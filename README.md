# Wordle Clone in React

A simple Wordle game clone built with React. This project is a fun and interactive way to test your vocabulary skills by guessing a five-letter word within six attempts.

## Features

- **Interactive Gameplay**: Users can guess the word by typing letters, and the game provides feedback by changing the colors of the tiles.
- **Responsive Design**: Optimized for both desktop and mobile devices. (_TODO_)
- **Word Validation**: Ensures that the guessed words are valid five-letter words.
- **Game Logic**: Includes win/loss conditions and displays appropriate messages. (_TODO_)
